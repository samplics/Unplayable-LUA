# Unplayable-LUA

### What is the Unplayable LUA?
The Unplayable LUA is a meme that will make your game randomly play sounds (literally at random, on damage taken, when you shoot, ect), and will also random display images, shapes, ect on your screen.

#### If you wish for me to add any more horrendous things to this LUA, I will gladly take it :)

### Warning:
This LUA downloads a ton of files (images, sounds, gifs, fonts) onto your pc. All files will be places in your INTERIUM folder at `/CSGO/FilesForLUA/sampli/Unplayable`.

### Warning 2:
There is a function in this LUA to create a 1 in 10,000 chance to randomly crash your game (lmao ik). So if you don't want your game to crash don't use it.

### Warning 3:
If you have epilepsy, or hate really loud noises, don't use this lmao.

#### All files are downloaded from discord cdn links, and all files downloaded are explained with comments in the LUA source code.
